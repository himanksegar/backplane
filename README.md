Desktop Agent bridge aka 'Backplane' is a component which allows different desktop agents to connect and communicate through websockets.

Where FDC3 Desktop Agent API addresses interoperability between apps running within the context of a single Desktop Agent (DA), facilitating cross-application workflows, FDC3 Desktop Agent Backplane addresses the interconnection of Desktop Agents (DAs) such that apps running under different Desktop Agents can also interoperate, allowing workflows to span multiple Desktop Agents

## Why Backplane?

Imagine a business workflow that involves applications which are not running under same desktop agent, how can we make applications interoperate across different desktop agents? This is where DA Backplane comes into picture.

The power and benefits of FDC3 based interoperability can be harnessed to full potential only if it is not just limited to boundaries of desktop agent but across desktop.

### ✔️ Workflows can be spanned to multiple desktop agents (DAs) on desktop.

### ✔️ Workflows can be spanned across multiple machines, provided they are operated by same user.

## Quick Start

See the guide here: [quick start](./docs/QuickStart.md).

## Hello World!

See how multi machine interop set up is done: [multi machine desktop agent(finsemble) bridging](./docs/HelloWorld.md) 


## Demo

Below is a short demonstration of how backplane is used to connect two desktop agents(finsemble), running on different machines, to share context among apps running in context of those desktop agents. 

This demonstrate how backplane can help you harness the benefits of FDC3 based interoperability to next level where interop breaks the boundry of not just desktop agents but single desktop too to span workflows across multiple desktop agents and machines.

## Usage example

See readme files.

- [backplane](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane/Readme.md).
- [backplane-client-js](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client.JS/README.md).
- [backplane-client-net](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client/Readme.md)

### Backplane

A desktop service which act as a message bus between multiple desktop agents for sending/receiving FDC3 compliant data.
See more here: [backplane](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane/Readme.md).

Client libraries provide API to connect and communicate with backplane.

### Backplane client JS

Javascript client which allows web based desktop agents to connect and communicate with backplane.

See more here: [backplane-client-js](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client.JS/README.md).

### Backplane client .NET

For desktop agent build in .NET, this client library exposed API to connect and communicate with backplane.

see more here: [backplane-client-net](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client/Readme.md)

## Development setup

IDE

1.  Visual Studio 2022.
2.  VS code.

Build

- Backplane

  See details here: [backplane](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane/Readme.md).

- .Net Client

  see details here: [backplane-client-net](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client/Readme.md)

- JS Client

  see details here: [backplane-client-js](./src/Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client.JS/README.md)

## Roadmap

1. Provide/enhance developer documentation.
2. Evolve the implementation to meet the emerging FDC3 specifications for Desktop Agent Bridging [Draft](https://github.com/finos/FDC3/blob/544-Desktop-Agent-Bridging-Proposal/docs/api-bridging/spec.md).
3. Deprecate interim DA to Bridge integrations as vendor support for standard enables direct bridge connections
4. Provide examples for multi host discovery implementations in line with concrete use cases.
5. Update system topology to include use of standalone Desktop Agent in line with emerging standard.
